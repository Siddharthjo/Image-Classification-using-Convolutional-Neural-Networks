Title: Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

Description:

Overview:
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision, containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. The goal of this project is to train a CNN model to accurately classify these images into one of the following classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.

Key Features:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The code includes functions to load the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras and preprocess the images by normalizing pixel values.

Model Architecture: A CNN model architecture is defined using the Sequential API in Keras. The model consists of convolutional layers, max pooling layers, dropout layers for regularization, and fully connected layers.

Training and Evaluation: The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with cross-entropy loss function. Training progress and performance metrics such as accuracy are monitored using validation data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance on unseen data. Metrics such as accuracy and classification reports are generated to evaluate model performance.

Prediction: The trained model can make predictions on new images. Functions are provided to preprocess new images and feed them into the model for prediction.

Getting Started:
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.

Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Code: Open and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided in the repository. Follow the instructions provided in the code to load the dataset, preprocess images, build the model, train, evaluate, and make predictions.

Experiment and Learn: Feel free to experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and training strategies. This project serves as a learning resource for understanding CNN-based image classification tasks.
